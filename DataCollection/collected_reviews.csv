Review
"wheres the new version? i reinstall its still old, the notification said i use previous version"
"Why PWA check is gone?"
"Highly recommend this SEO friendly tool for your website"
"I do not have the PWA option in any browser and with any PWA web site."
"There is no pwa test option showing in my pc only four options it is showing performance,seo,accessibilty,best practice, is there any other thing we have to change in setting if any one has the idea of this problem please tell me"
"Where is PWA test?"
"Nice tool to get in-depth analysis for website in desktop & mobile mode. Also provides one to one suggestion for issues solving."
"Good extension but I honestly prefer to just use the chrome dev tools instead without an extra extension, nonetheless cant really complain didn't have any issues just not much reason to keep it when its built in by pressing F12..?"
"Great Tool!"
"I love this! Whenever a website is slow, I can see if it's my issue or if the website is acting up."
"Could it be that the lighthouse score is based on network latency and that you're experiencing some type of cold start on your http service?"
"I had a client complain once because their pagespeed score was in the low 40's. I ignored the email since this was an old site (built before pagespeed existed) and a client I fired for multiple reasons a few years back. Anyhow, they emailed to thank me the next day because the score was in the 90's. I didn't change a thing, nor did anyone else.

"Maybe your servers are inconsistent? check the details to see which resources are taking the longest."
"If you cannot consistently get 90+ scores, you need to optimize something. Might be server side, might be client side."
"I have done this many times and can get to 100 points with a bit of effort."
"Also i.e. IIS (Windows webserver) does not gzip compress static files unless they are accessed often - and other stuff like that. So everytime you need to run a Lighthouse test, press F5 a couple of times on the page before running the tool."
"Lighthouse measures real performance - so if you check an online website, and it sometimes has load from other visitors, your score will be affected because of lacking performance. If you cannot consistently get 90+ scores, you need to optimize something. Might be server side, might be client side. I have done this many times and can get to 100 points with a bit of effort.

You're just fooling yourself with that, if the cold load for a given page is slow, this is what your visitors will experience. Test under the worst possible conditions (empty server & client cache), then use the results to inform your optimization strategy. If the server doesn't gzip content where appropriate, go fix the server."

"If you want to check for actual page speed then use https://pagespeed.web.dev/."
"That will grade your page speed as a Google Bot would, which is far more useful to know if you'll be indexed properly or not."
"Don't use the debug tools lighthouse scores, those are mainly for checking if you have bad imports or any accessibility issues. If you want to check for actual page speed then use https://pagespeed.web.dev/. That will grade your page speed as a Google Bot would, which is far more useful to know if you'll be indexed properly or not. 10 more replies 10 more replies More replies"

"You have to combine different versions of lighthouse. Some are synthetic some are real. I usually run bunch on web.dev, then some on my machine, mixed with gtmetrix and page speed insight."
"I did a video about Lighthouse earlier this year. I think it's great. It definitely found problems with my website and I fixed them."
"The numbers might fluctuate on a bunch of things. One... are you using http or https when you enter the URL? If your site redirects to https, you could lose points because of the redirection. If you're not using https, then you're going to lose points."
"It's hard to know if it's a problem with lighthouse without seeing the report. I've seen fluctuation of a few percentage points. But that big of a range is probably something else."
"I don't know what's wrong, but I suspect there might be something wrong with the site."

But that big of a range is probably something else. I don't know what's wrong, but I suspect there might be something wrong with the site."
"I've also seen Lighthouse scores fluctuate pretty wildly - exact same page, run seconds apart. I started to asking averages, which gets pretty time-consuming, but hopefully a bit more reliable."
"Make sure to cross reference with lighthouse-metrics and gtmetrics because I have found sometimes mine and others sites will score very high on the later and poorly on the former which is curious"
"To get more consistent results you can try to use synthetic web performance monitoring using tools like SpeedCurve."
"Yep, Lighthouse behave strange last year, sometimes you change something in caching an it decreases Cumulative Layout Shift etc... I just working with main issues, and Lighthouse recommendations is just a hints, no more. I hope you know, the most important part is to render the first screen (above the fold) as fast as possible. Postpone loading of content below. Preloading images for first screen. Preferably no JS in header etc. It always go good, but CLS really hurts, and last time I don't understand why it can be fixed with caching reconfigured etc."
"By the way, real data from visitors for CLS is ok."
"Lighthouse is great because it helps you identify easy wins for performance and accessibility. No one ever made their website worse by following lighthouse optimization recommendations."
"Google lighthouse results are one of the factors ranked by Google search.Do poorly and you will be punished on Google.com"
"You can score 100 on accessibility and still ship an unusable piece of shit. I'm not sure if the others stack up like that, but I doubt it; I imagine performance is done if it says 100? Accessibility testing still requires manual testing and common sense for the majority."
"Lighthouse is a useful tool, but I would also conduct some simple usability tests if you can. See Steve Krug's book, Don't Make Me Think."
"In terms of accessibility you'd be better off using aXe dev tools or running aXe against your pages via automated tests. Lighthouse uses a subset of aXe tests for accessibility, aXe itself only covers about 50%, iirc, of WCAG standards. Essentially Lighthouse is a good indicator of accessibility but it isn't that comprehensive and ultimately if you think ""wow we got 100 for a11y on Lighthouse"" and never bother to test accessibility any further you've probably got a bunch of a11y issues."
"Yes. Make the initial changes in LH then use Google's page speed tool to get additional insights into performance. Also, try using slow 3g and disable cache, will help you identify slow network issues on mobile such as CLS."
"Website content is more important, don't get bogged down by lighthouse. Just use it to look to cherry pick easy issues then move on. https://gtmetrix.com/ also a good site to find issues."
"I've seen Lighthouse report some comically inaccurate performance numbers (such as a 0.5s page load being reported as a 15 second page load), so definitely don't use its perf metrics as gospel. However, the Lighthouse suggestions for improving performance are all solid"
"Absolutely. Considering Google dominates search engine use you're literally looking at how well your page will rank. There are definitely other things you can do that Lighthouse doesn't cover, but it's very helpful."
"Yes, it's good to have a performance indicator of a site in a dev environment, but as user numbers increase and the variety of devices so, it's worth switching to real data measurement tools like GA."
"Yes, Google Lighthouse is a great metric... for Google."
"I'm still waiting for a ChatGPT-like tool for scoring content the way pagespeed tools rank page mechanics. A (possibly very large) subset of people focus on numerical scores, page rankers assign numerical scores, and therefore those people focus intently on boosting their numbers over content credibility, readability, and authority."
"excellent, thanks you."
"Supertool! Thanks for authors."
"Excelent tool for enhancing the performance of your website, the report is quite extensive"
"Great extension. I have about 5 years since I am using it and is one of the 4 that I always have pined."
"Why can't I easily find the mobile-friendly view option? It's frustrating and a waste of time."
"New update that removes it from the developer tools limits the functionality to only giving it an URL. This limits websites that use auth in different ways such as cookie tokens, tab exclusive auth tokens, etc. It opens on a new tab which I rather not."
"Good plugin but would be more useful if it also included desktop tests. Only mobile tests are currently being performed"
"There is a settings menu you can open by clicking on the cog in the top-right to change this."
"Amazing, for some reason that I ignore this Lighthouse addon works one thousand times better than the version integrated in the browser.  Congratulations guys, keep the good work."
"Not working at all!!!"
"It looks greeat trying to improve our eshop https://eshop.vinarstvizapletal.cz/"
"Lighthouse dev tools is a good utility tool from chrome web store."
"It works, but the problem is that it hasn't been updated in so long that it is using an old Lighthouse version.  Even get a lil notification saying that.  So it's better to just use an alternative means of getting this data."
"Since 2019 Oct, the extension has simply used Page Speed Insights API and so has been using the most recent version of Lighthouse ever since. We don't need to update the extension with every new Lighthouse release."
"Works well but gives totaly different report than the console version of lighthouse. Why? whats up with that?"
"Very useful, not complicated"
"i like it so far!"
"good choice , well worth a look"
"its very nice"
"Sadly, this hasn't been updated since Version 8.0 and the latest is 8.3. If you rely on this tool now, you're getting a way different reading from what Google is getting."
"Since 2019 Oct, the extension has simply used Page Speed Insights API and so has been using the most recent version of Lighthouse ever since. We don't need to update the extension with every new Lighthouse release."
"Neat. I'm not a programmer but it's a lil entartaining seeing the report of sites. Does it's stuff"
"This is pretty useful!I the only things I think is missing are: 1. Present both mobile/desktop results instea of each separetly, we actually need both! 2. Please add the locale query string parameter into the settings (My clients are spanish speakers, so I have to add &locale=es to each new report. Thanks!!!"
"I like having the choice between the extension and the option in devtools. Can you document somewhere what version of axe is being used for the accessibility checks? Axe 4.2 has about twice as many accessibility tests as lighthouse so it would be good to understand the differences in a clear manner."
"It doesn't support incognito mode. If I run a test in incognito mode, it opens the test result in normal browser, fix this issue plz then it will be worth of 5*"
"How update to 7.2.0"
"It is very useful toll, when it will be updated? Last Updated November 20, 2019"
"No need to update, it uses the latest version of Lighthouse always via the PageSpeed Insights API."
"nice"
"Just got introduced into Lighthouse 6.0 and I honestly love the features it has to offer! The small suggestions on what should be changed on the website do help for those freelance web developers with no design experience. Thank you Devs!"
"good plugin."
"dont  show in extension bar"
"nice tools"
"update version pls"
"useful"
"Hay un error!!! Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined Corríjanlo!"
"Waiting for Lighthouse results ... after 5s Error rendering report: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"
"Good Tool! It can be used for quick results."
"Used to work offline as version 5.4.0.0 but now with version 100.0.0.0 it fails while it looks for gitHub."
"Lighthouse is a MUST for any serious dev. I use it in conjunction with the WebHint extension."
"usefully"
"This extension is now built in to Chrome dev tools."
"Very good app... Suddenly crashed though... Log File: **Lighthouse Version**: 5.2.0 **Lighthouse Commit**: ba1e1591dd83fe411f058df31a994df76796f646 **Chrome Version**: 76.0.3809.132 **Initial URL**: https://gabbitas.com/ **Error Message**: Waiting for DevTools protocol response has exceeded the allotted time. (Method: Network.clearBrowserCache) **Stack Trace**: ``` LHError: PROTOCOL_TIMEOUT at chrome-extension://blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk/scripts/lighthouse-ext-bundle.js:22728:11 ```"
"Doesn't work at all on Debian systems. Useless."
"very helpful browser icon :-)"
"ok"
"helpfull"
"Works good but can you update to the latest light house version to match web.dev ?"
"ok"
"Very interesting"
"The overview forgets to mention, you don't need this extension anymore - the feature it built into DevTools in the current version of Chrome. Installing this gives you nothing new. Just use the 'Audits' tab in DevTools."
"Simply one of the best performance tools you can use. It only continues to improve."
"good potential. Currently limited to 1 use case only. More detail should be given for the 3G network simulation as that means many different speeds depending on country."
"Best ever I found in my 12 years career."
"I think this tool has great potential, but unfortunately, at the moment it is only possible to run an audit emulating on mobile Nexus 5X and using a 3G network connection, which doesn't make much sense to me. At its current state, I'll stick to the DevTools version, where it's possible to choose the emulation options."
"It's a good tool, but as it stands it can only generate one report, then the extension needs to be deactivated and reactivated because all buttons in its GUI stops responding after the first usage."
"Why is this emulating a nexus... on a 3G network? Does anyone even use 3G anymore? Lets get a bit more modern and use LTE or WIFI speeds and stop throttling, or at least allow user running the test to set their own environment."
"Awesome..."
"Great App,I hope there will be more features"
"Great extension !!!"
"Excellent utility!!!"
"Doesnt work for Chrome in Mac. The browser is updated to the latest version. It doesn't even give any error or compatibility issues with other plugins that I am using."
"Excellent for testing and debugging issues!"
"Fantastic tool for developing Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and optimizing your site for its full potential!"
"Easy to use. Good extension! Thanks!"
"Good extension."
"Broken. Records page load times as REALLY long incorrectly"
"This has stopped working, was fine a few days ago."
"it doesn't work at all"
"Latest version broke. :( Good thing there's an alternate way in Chrome to run the report."
"perfect!"
"Awesome tool. Highly recommended."
"Good! Extension is very useful"
"Good tool for Onsite SEO and web dev."
"Very useful so far. Also frightening."
"Very useful. Takes a minute to understand the true value of what the numbers represent but then its fantastic"
"Works great i have got a lot of use."
"Really quick, useful tool to help me spot errors across clients sites."
"This has been a great help while optimizing my websites."
"Keep it up ! Still need some further improvement."
"It always try to run mobile checks first, so sites redirect to mobile version and this bornbroken thing start to test only mobile site."
"Outstanding!"
"Great tool to assisting an SEO and web devOps!"
"Broken. Tried repeatedly, different sites, always sticks on 'Loading page & waiting for onload'."
"Sometimes works, sometimes doesnt work. Overall good."
"essential. every web site developer should test their sites with this and fix any reported issues. The screenshots are out of date - it looks nicer than it shows. :-)"
"Report says : Open new tabs using rel='noopener' to improve performance and prevent security vulnerabilities. But, a rel=noreferrer has the same behaviour as noopener. Update must be made."
"Great tool, very very helpful"
"Great tool. The node CLI is great too. I've used with chrome on windows 10 and my 2015 macbook pro."
"Very helpful tool!"
"So useful and so easy to get into."
"Simply superb"
"It is good for a quick checkup, but it ignores offline functionality implemented with app cache (which is still necessary while Edge and Safari lack service worker support)."
"Quick perf rule analysis that takes into account making the web 'Reliable' for your users. Confirms you are caching content for offline scenarios with service workers. Love It!"
"It is awesome tool to test service worker functionality in application by developer and other people who wants to verify the service worker implementation."
"They are playing by the same rules; page speed simply isn't the only (nor the most important) factor in ranking. If you search for 'Amazon Kindle' some little blog with a 100/100 lighthouse score shouldn't come first."
"You're right. I've been doing SEO for years now for clients and on my own site. I rank #2 for a few local keywords, and I'll never rank #1. Wanna know why? The #1 spot has a PBN. My site is objectively better in terms of on page SEO, UX, lighthouse / page speed scores, and I have a blog that pumps out fresh content (he doesn't have one). But Google doesn't care. It's because he has a PBN setup with thousands of backlinks, is why he holds that spot. No matter what Google says, ranking well has always been about and will always be about backlinks."
"Ultimately, Google and any other search engine is interested in showing the best results for a given query to users. How often a user clicks on a result and whether or not the user returns to search and ends up clicking a different result are basically the most important thing for ranking. But they also know that things like performance and responsiveness and accessibility are, in addition to content, important factors in predicting whether a user will remain on a site or leave (if the page is really slow, you're gonna have a bad experience, and possibly go elsewhere). So performance is just one of many factors. Relevance to the query and how many users made a similar query for which that result was what they were looking for are and should be the most important factors. That basically means the popularity of a site is one of the key factors in ranking."
"To be clear, lighthouse scores is a TIE BREAKER. The search term matching is absolutely more important and it's honestly going to be rare where you have the same score as another website and lighthouse scoring tiebreaker will come into play. Get high LH scores to make your site more pleasant to use, not to get a higher ranking on SERP."
"Page speed is massively overstated for SEO. It's a very small factor. Of course it's good to have a fast site anyway, for your users, but most people wouldn't notice a difference between 80-100 lighthouse score. Plus lighthouse massively undervalues TTFB (time to first byte)."
"It's just a tie breaker. That's it, you honestly shouldn't expect it to place you more than a single ranking higher. I've never seen it have an effect tbh. That said, absolutely try to get a good ranking (doesn't need to be 100/100) because it makes your site more pleasant to use."
"It depends on what your site is for. I basically think of the following dichotomy: sites people have to use vs sites people don't have to use. An example of a site people don't have to use is an online retailer. Since people could go elsewhere, performance really matters. It's showing how a minor bit of extra time to load can affect conversion numbers. Here you should be aiming to get that lighthouse score perfect. An example of a site people have to use is a B2B sass app that does some business function like product management software, intranets, etc. Its users HAVE to use it because their company paid for them to use it. While we should strive to build performant sites every time blah blah blah, the truth is it becomes much less important in these kind of sites as you essentially have a captive audience."
"Well that to Amazon, last time I checked their lighthouse site performance was 30 something."
"In my opinion, having a decent Lighthouse/page speed/etc. score should be the bare minimum. There are a lot of other factors to consider when thinking of quality and speed (which are not mutually exclusive): perceived speed and providing feedback in the UI when things are happening, length of flows (especially with checkouts), amount of info collected on forms, partial updates vs full page loads (non-SPA), ensuring minimal re-renders (SPA), pagination vs infinite scroll and when to use them. There are no scoring tools for a 'good' website. But using things like Lighthouse and page speed are a good indicator it isn't your code causing the problems."
"I'm not really concerned with SEO. I try to make websites that are fast, nice to use, accessible, and have a low web carbon. Lighthouse is a useful metric for this."
"Google wants that the stuff you find on google works. If you used google and only found crappy pages that took seconds to load, you'd think google was crap."
"Does it matter? Depends. looks like you're thinking about in SERPs. IMHO in 20 years of SEO, the same ideas still hold true. Have backlinks, Create good content , (Use words your customers are searching for in your headings and other content areas), and make the site easy to use where they don't bounce. That's it. The pagespeed score factors in there somewhere, but all those technical metrics only matter when everything else is about equal. It's why older or slow sites still rank well. People keep going there and people keep linking to it, and they keep linking to it because people go there..... and so on. I've had customers obsess of synthetic metrics, meanwhile they want to rank for terms they don't even have service pages for, or are thin on content. SMH."
"It is a relatively small factor. It does play a role in ranking, however most other factors have to be very similar between sites for it to come into effect."
"Good question. It should matter but if they don't then perhaps it's another sign that search engines have lost the SEO war. The systems they introduced to return the best results from the internet were quickly overwhelmed by people learning to game the algorithm for profit. Once Google achieved its near total search monopoly, they shifted to serving adverts over good quality results so things like Lighthouse scores don't get a chance to make the difference. That said, I still think the audits are valuable. The metrics are measuring tangible, real-world things and it's the most universal front end analysis tool to you can see how site A compares with site B. I do think a site with a good Lighthouse score (achieved genuinely) usually feels better to use, and while that may not matter as much to search engines, it still matters to users. Also, because they're presented in a style that's digestible by anyone, you can use the results in presentations too."
"Lighthouse score doesn't affect search ranking. Core Web Vitals from field data do. It's important to have good CWV and Lighthouse can help you improve those but it's completely possible to have a good Lighthouse score and a bad performing site and vice versa."
"Content matters the most. But I would bet it can help give you a boost if you and your competitor are both cranking out quality content."
"I mean, if you 'accidentally' get 90/100, by all means advertise that. But some clients think it's then end all be all. And most of the (IME) the biggest offenders are things you don't control."
"It definitely impacts your rankings. I work at a relatively larger tech company and we've had multiple drop-everything perf issues because Google notified us that we'd start getting down ranked if we didn't fix perf on specific pages. That said, some sites are so relevant that having bad performance doesn't really impact their ratings. If you search for short term rentals somewhere, Airbnb is getting clicks and converts so often that they're going to stay at the top essentially no matter what. Site performance is a very important metric, but it's not the only metric, so things balance out."
"Aren't Airbnb known for being good engineering wise though?"
"I'm of the mindset that building performant web apps is so easy that you'd be stupid not too. Honestly I find it harder to get bad scores and the code becomes a pain to read. Just follow best practices for HTML, CSS & JavaScript and then even when building something in React or another framework it'll usually end up good enough. I usually end up with things being built with at least 85 performance, easily tweaked to 100. I've heard some people have issues with analytics trackers etc."
"Not much, until someone ignorant enough makes it your quarterly KPI."
"It's a very impactful metric. Especially for small business sites in local markets. The reason the bigger sites can get away with low scores is because their domain authority makes up for it. They have tens of thousands of backlinks and social media engagement and reach online that their page speed score doesn't really matter. When you have a high authority site with 20k backlinks and lots of social engagement versus a new site with no backlinks and no social profiles but 100 page speed scores guess who's gonna win? Thats how it works. Small business sites don't have the Authority those big sites have. So they need to play the game a lot differently and that's where page speed matters the most. They don't have domain authority. So they need to make up for it on content quality and page speed scores to gain an edge over their local competition."
"Lighthouse scores change all the time. There's usually not that much in it but it's never the same each time. I doubt it had anything to do with your browser."
"Usually it's because browser adons or plugins are affecting the score but are not there in the incognito test. I always test in incog for that reason."
"Every site I have built and run thought lighthouse scored very well, but had first contentful paint times in the 5 to 10 second range, even though the timeline clearly shows everything loaded in less than 1 second. I still can't figure that out."
