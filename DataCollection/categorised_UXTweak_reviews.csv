"For me, it is UXtweak - very affordable, easy to use and you get a lot of extra research tools you can use anytime you need them (card sorts, tree tests, first click test, website and mobile app usability testing etc.)",Usability & Workflow
"I have tried out UXTweak. Here's what I like: I like the control you have in specifying the tasks and integrations with Figma. Survey tool is actually pretty capable. Monthly subscription, since only part of my job is UX (I do CMI now, which is basically product focused marketing research, or ""UX"" lol). I'd rather pay 30% more for monthly. Obviously, the capability to test post-launch apps was huge for me but I don't think I can specify the tasks so I doubt it gathers metrics for me. The UI is a bit weird/confusing but not annoyingly so.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"I also looked at UXTweak, I thought functionally it had the best features, but was the more expensive and less pretty option.",Feature Requests
"I would suggest UXtweak - most tools offered (card sorting, tree testing, prototype testing, mobile app testing, etc.) and after Maze increased prices last year I think it is the best price/value option on the market at the moment.",Positive Feedback
"Hi I've been using UXtweak for past months, it has free trial which is limited but let me get the feel for the tool and than they have paid subscription, I usually use it only to test my website for photography so I sign up for a month, do the study and sign off. So far I'm satisfied with the tool and its usability for my psuedo researches for my personal purposes.",Positive Feedback
"We trialed both of them and ended up choosing UXtweak. What I can say about both is that they have great account/customer success teams, huge difference when compared to UT.",Positive Feedback
The reason we ended up with UXtweak was mostly because A) we found the quality of the panel to be much better (also they had more participants available) B) moderated research tool (we do a lot of user interviews)",Positive Feedback
"Overall I can recommend UXtweak if you are looking to replace UT/UZ, there are some minor things like the user interface being pretty clunky but when it comes to value/cost I think it is the option that makes sense.",Usability & Workflow
"When I was choosing tools I evaluated UserTesting vs UXtweak vs Userlytics. We dropped UT very quickly due to price, then had a trial of UXtweak and Userlytics, ended up choosing UXtweak and I am satisfied.",Positive Feedback
"Lot of folks mentioned Maze - which definitely is a good option but it got a lot more expensive lately. I would recommend looking at UXtweak",Positive Feedback

"I found this platform by accident while I wanted to improve traffic on my website, but I am really glad for this accident. UXtweak was a really helpful tool for me to analyze what is good and bad with my website. How should I sort my cards and what are the strongest aspects and weakest aspects of my website. Also, the support team was really helpful with my requests and concerns. I would go with 4.5/5 since I think there is always room for improvement, but it's not an option here, so I will go with 5. Keep it up.",Positive Feedback
"My experience with UXtweak is a pretty pleasant one. I first started to use UXtweak when I was in college studying UX. It was great for me, since it had a free plan that could satisfy my then needs as a UX junior. After I graduated, UXtweak became my go-to tool whenever I needed to conduct any type of research. It is really comprehensive, and I could test everything, prototypes, websites, and now they added mobile app testing which I haven't got the opportunity to test yet.",Positive Feedback
"A few times I had some minor problems, so I wrote to support if they could help me, and they were always very nice, and helpful. I even remember they implemented a small thing into the tool I needed. I really love this tool, and I will probably use it until the end of my days :D.",Positive Feedback
"This allowed me to take advantage of professional research tools even though we do not have a budget for them.",Positive Feedback
"Due to my amount of cards, the analysis tools where confusing to interpret simply because of the big amount of data.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Great value for all-in-one usability testing toolkit.",Positive Feedback
"We really like 5 Second Tests and Preference Testing features.",Positive Feedback
"We didn't find anything we don't like, but we use the session recording feature the least, but it's mostly our fault.",Feature Requests
"We planned to redesign our website for the 20th anniversary of our company and decided to take it seriously that is why we opted for UXtweak. As I first thing we run a Replay Visitor study to observe how users used our old website - from results of this test we designed the new web. Then we tested the new design with Replay Tasks to validate it and optimize. We were satisfied with the results.",Performance & Accuracy
"The amount of research tools UXtweak offers and how powerful they are when used back to back.",Positive Feedback
"As I don't enjoy reading a lot I would really appreciate video tutorials for all the features they offer. Apart from that, I had no problem.",Feature Requests
"We've been looking for a tool that combines all of the UX research exercises we require including usability testing, tree testing, first impression testing etc. Not many UX research tools include this many.",Usability & Workflow
"It can be quite hard to find your way around the dashboard. We had a go at using the usability tool ourselves and found it hard to move between the test screen and the website.",Usability & Workflow
"As a graphic designer in heart I was always more focused on the visual part of websites or interfaces I designed up to this point. UXtweak helped me to realise usability is the number one priority.",Usability & Workflow
"Fast and simple implementation with GTM manager that I use on a daily bases was without a problem. Variety of features to take a full advantage of all usability testing and UX research methods. Great documentation and customer care to find answers to your questions.",Feature Requests
"I liked everything about this platform but I would recommend some type of tutorial videos - documentation is great but nevertheless video gets you up to the speed faster.",Positive Feedback
"Is a very intuitive tool, is easy to follow. I created tests very fast and I was able to share them easily with my team before launching. Then once I gather data I was able to download the raw answers, and a complete analysis as well. very helpful and easy to interpret.",Positive Feedback
"Sometimes it was buggy when I was creating certain tasks.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Love having all possible UX tests in one place! So I have my Figma prototype tests, website tests, surveys, and card sortings all together. Plus the new feature of the own participant database allows me to have a decent user CRM that I can use for my tests. And a special kudos goes to the randomisation features everywhere, so I know that the order bias is controlled in my tests.",Feature Requests
"Sometimes the interface of it could be not 100% intuitive, so you need to invest some time in exploring the tool.",Usability & Workflow
"The fact that it offers a free plan as well as generous discounts for nonprofit organization. This allowed me to take advantage of professional research tools even though we do not have a budget for them.",Positive Feedback
"I needed to run a simple card sorting exercises and some surveys to collect feedback. The platform offer a lot of options I didn't need, so it can be a bit overwhelming at first.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"UXTweak's best feature is its intuitive interface and ready-made tools which save tons of time while designing UX test. All the built-in animations and page transitions were welcomed by the participants of the focus groups I organised. So, it is not only helpful for me as a researcher, but also for the people who take the tests. So far it is the best UX tool I ever used.",Feature Requests
"The layout of the dashboard might be unfamiliar at first, but after setting up a couple of test you get used to it and everything fall into place. Further, their support team is super helpful. There is live chat option, as well as the contact form. They got back to me in the same day with tons of tips and solved all the problems I had.",Positive Feedback
"UX Tweak is a powerful tool that helps my company testing the new site structure. Its easy to use, and the analysis tool helps us find the right solutions.",Usability & Workflow
"Overall UX tweak deliver everything I need for site structure testing.",Positive Feedback
"I used Card Sorts as part of my PhD research methodology. I research creativity and second language development in adult ESOL learners. The tool has helped me to explore how adult ESOL learners conceptualise the concepts of creativity and second language development.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"I used Uxtweak for card sorting. Before using UXtweak, I researched and tested many different platforms, however, only UXtwek met my requirements. I liked the flexibility that it offered. It allowed me to include statements in two languages on the cards, which was an essential requirement for my research project. I needed to obtain open, multiple sorts from each participant and the platform made it easy to design. It is a great tool for big-scale and small-scale research projects. The customer service was excellent too. Communication was easy, and the staff was very competent, supportive, and friendly.",Usability & Workflow
"I do not have anything negative to say about this product. My only comment would be that the process of sorting can be a bit more technically difficult to do on a mobile device for some participants. It is doable but needs some practice. It is not an issue, but it is something worth explaining to research participants.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"I gave UXtweak a try because they offer a lot of features for one affordable subscription. After the first data came in, I decided to make it my primary UX tool and I am using it since.",Feature Requests
"I mostly used session recordings due to advanced filters they have. Their 'SmartSearch' - filters allow you to find out every events users took on your website without the need to set anything up beforehand. This means you will be saving a ton of time when reviewing results and searching through user recordings. You can track events and find out how they influence each other or generate click, scroll and move heatmaps on demand.",Performance & Accuracy
"Only thing that bugged me is that new features get rolled out often and I could not keep track with it.",Feature Requests
"We're using it to optimise a shopping taxonomy in an eCommerce site. We were able to increase the findability of products and services. Our customers who participated in the study gave a lot of positive feedback about the study - a lot of them enjoyed the survey and loved the fact that we're asking their opinion to improve the site.",Positive Feedback
"I have used the Tree Test functionality. It is really quick easy to set-up a study. Very user-friendly interface. And the results are well presented, easy to analyse and have great visualisations. It made it very easy to present results to our stakeholders. Absolutely loved it! The support over chat was fantastic - very responsive and helpful.",Performance & Accuracy
"I don't have anything negative to say about the tool.",Positive Feedback

"Ease of use and tutorials integrated into the product.",Positive Feedback
"Still needing to determine any negatives.",Positive Feedback
"Very good tool that allows us to do things that we can not with any other tool from competition. It is very straight forward and easy to use. It has a great support that is very helpful. We see a great potential in this tool and we hope that it will result in a great UX and higher conversion rate on our website.",Positive Feedback
"- easy to use - great features - great support - very reasonable price - easy setup",Positive Feedback
"- one missing functionality (already being added)",Feature Requests
"We have tested the forms on one of our projects and saw, that many people were struggling at some point. It helped us to optimize it.",Positive Feedback
"We have tried UXtweak for our upcoming projects and for existing as well. Features like tree testing and card sorting were easy to use, without the need to study any tutorials or documentation. We have also tried the user testing and recording feature, but not without opening documentation. The results were interesting, we have never tried testing like this before.",Feature Requests
"The software is quite complex, so I would recommend adding more hints into the administration (especially in the user testing section).",Usability & Workflow
"UXtweak is simple and easy to use. The configuration is well-explained, easy and yet very customizable. The analysis methods gives both a simple and quick overview as well as a in-depth insight in the subjects behavior and answers.",Usability & Workflow
"Would love to see a pilot study function included. That is, the possibility to launch the study temporarily, get some results, look at the data, make some changes in the setup and the launch for good.",Performance & Accuracy
"It's remote friendly and intuitive for most users. The card sort is well mapped to an in real life experience of such a task. My card sort existed of 65 cards, which is not really recommended to use by UXtweak, but it was still possible for the testpersons to get an ok overview of the carpets to sort and the categories the made. The list of cards to be sorted force them to interpret one carpet at a time as they have to drag them over in categories. This might not have been carried out as thorough in real life scenario.",Usability & Workflow
"Due to my amount of cards, the analysis tools where confusing to interpret simply because of the big amount of data. Moreover would it be nice with some more analysis tools such as MDS - multi dimensional scaling. Which I could have benefitted from.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"A super easy way to do remote UX testing directly on the web Replaying sessions of respondents and normal online visitors. The search feature is very powerful and gives a lot of options for exploring the recorded data. Incorporates several of the techniques I already used, including card sorting and tree testing. We can recruit respondents for testing directly on our web.",Feature Requests
"Nothing in particular. It's a new service, so there are a few flaws to iron out. But they were quite receptive to feedback in their chat.",Usability & Workflow
"Step-by-step card sort set-up and execution made it easy for even our junior researchers to use. Overall allowed us to collect and analyze our results to improve our website- and that's exactly what we needed. Not only was the tool great, but the customer service was what made this a perfect experience. We received assistance directly from the CEO and he was extremely kind and helpful. Will continue to use this service for our UX needs.",Positive Feedback
"Nothing at the moment. It's a great tool and is very straightforward and easy to use.",Positive Feedback
"Complete UX research tool, it offers replay sessions which is super useful, tree testing and card sorting. And all of that directly on my website using visitors as respondents for studies.",Positive Feedback
"Nothing. A quick look in documentation solved the few uncertainties I had.",Usability & Workflow
"Despite the fact, I am new to UX and usability testing I was able to create a successful study which provided me with valuable insight.",Positive Feedback
"It is complex so it certainly has a learning curve.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"It has easy-to-understand docs and is free for small business. I can see what the customers are doing on my website and improve it.",Positive Feedback
"It has so many features, I am not familiar with all of them. Short intro videos in English would be really appreciated.",Feature Requests
"Love the interface design, easy to use, complete and so kind and resolutive customer service.",Positive Feedback
"Nothing negative to say at the moment. I was using the platform for my University Final Project after compare it with others brands.",Positive Feedback
"It's packed with multi-functionality in a single package. Allows you to conduct multiple different tests within just 1 subscription.",Positive Feedback
"Comparing with some of the top competitors out there, UXtweak does not shy away with the features that it has and it's super easy to use with a very user-friendly and intuitive way that you can jump on it in no time.",Feature Requests
"The fact that someone whose primary focus is UI and being able to pick this out and started to jump on using it is quite impressive. It really shows the dedication the team has put into designing this product.",Positive Feedback
"It supports users being able to conduct tests on mobile and desktop. This gives users the freedom to freely conduct from different access points. Both platform testing is well designed and not an afterthought.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"PDF export is a bit meh. The web portal gives users so much more information in a much nicer way.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"I did this for testing purposes but in real-life scenarios, I would be manually doing screenshots of each different page than actually using this feature as it's just not comprehensive enough and more difficult to look at.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Some of the features are a bit hidden and need time to snoop around. I think there can be improvements made to have an even better UI/UX.",Feature Requests
"The left-hand side nav takes a lot of space, or the tabs within a project also take a bit of space so leaves a small room for the actual data you've collected.",Positive Feedback
"There's a full-screen button but it takes away the additional stuff so I would say it's a bit unfortunate. But as it is right now it still beats the majority of products on the market.",Positive Feedback
"Although the tree/card sorting allowed users to be using both mobile and desktop, there isn't a way to filter the result. Sometimes it might be good to understand if that has any impact on the user's result. There might not be any for a test like this.",Feature Requests
"I was impressed by the customer support I received. I emailed the company with a question regarding the tools and services offered. I received a response within hours from [SENSITIVE CONTENT].",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"The response was very thorough and helped me learn more about what UXTweak offers. I even got a response to a follow-up email during the weekend, which was an unexpected and pleasant surprise!",Positive Feedback
"I like that you can see demos of each tool, so you get a real view of how the data is presented. Instead of just reading what the tool can be used for, you can actually interact with the demo and pretend you conducted the study, such as replaying recordings and filtering participants.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"The Session Recording tool was easy to set up, even though I'd never done website tracking before.",Usability & Workflow
"The toolbar at the side of the dashboard is unclear for a new user like me, who hasn't yet memorized what each icon means. The icons all look very similar: they are all the same color, and most of them contain the same shapes (rounded squares), which makes it hard to distinguish between them.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"It's difficult to know instinctively which button to click on because they don't have labels. The name of the tool is not revealed even if you hover over the button. It's only after you click the button that a pop-up window appears and reveals the name of the tool.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"It took me a while to learn this because I did not think to click it: my instincts told me that if I clicked the button, it would take me to a different page.",Versioning & Updates
"There is some lag between a website visitor and when the visitor is recorded in UXTweak. I discovered this when I was testing my study. Whenever I visited my own website, it would take about 10 minutes for my visit to appear in the analysis section.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"At first, I thought that the study wasn't recording data properly, which made me anxious.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Session Recording: It would be even easier to set up if there were some instructions describing how to install the snippet.",Feature Requests
"A complex solution for all your user research needs.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"I like how you have all the user research tools in one place. It was a big benefit for us, as the team was not ready to invest in a bunch of different tools every time we introduce a new research method.",Positive Feedback
"Another big plus is the quality of support. Big thanks to UXtweak support team for being so responsive and helping us solve minor setup complications in no time!",Positive Feedback
"I really missed branding customization options, it is not available in the Plus plan.",Feature Requests
"I use the tree test tool from UXtweak to test the menu navigation.",Usability & Workflow
"As a UX Design teacher, I have my students conduct a number of card sorting sessions. However, you cannot test whether users of your website or app can find a topic through your navigation. That is why you should always do a tree test in addition to card sorting sessions.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"UX Tweak's tree test tool is extremely useful. You simply build your navigation and then set up a number of questions. You forward the test to multiple test persons through email. Through the UX Tweak results page you can track exactly how your users understood your navigation. A fantastic tool and indispensable for every UX Designer.",Performance & Accuracy
"Nothing, I only have compliments for the tool.",Positive Feedback
"Great tool for mobile app testing.",Positive Feedback
"We used UXtweak to test usability of our mobile app's interface and it helped greatly. We were able to recruit a rather niche audience of participants directly in the app, which honestly saved a lot of time.",Usability & Workflow
"The study had great analytics for each task of our test. There are also recordings for each session that you can come back to for further analysis.",Positive Feedback
"Although the in-app recruiting was super handy, the main issue was that you can't recruit participants for less than $200. We don't always need this many testers, so that's definitely a limitation.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Figma prototype testing for quick design validation.",Usability & Workflow
"I love how easy and quick it is to set up the tests. To import the prototype from Figma you just need a link. It imports all your transitions directly from Figma or you can choose to connect the screens manually during setup.",Positive Feedback
"The analytics are great, you can easily filter out specific respondent groups, based on different criteria, and analyze results for each of them. I like that you can get a great amount of qual and quant insights without having to spend hours on the manual analysis.",Performance & Accuracy
"I guess the biggest drawback for some teams could be that they only support Figma and Invision testing.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Quality recruiting for usability tests.",Usability & Workflow
"We recruited a bunch of participants for unmoderated usability tests from the user panel and it was a great experience! The responses we've got were useful and the recruiting process was very quick.",Usability & Workflow
"After hearing a couple of horror stories about participants from panels not showing up to tests and faking responses I was a bit sceptical but it went great and we actually got some nice insights about user behavior.",Performance & Accuracy
"I don't like that there's no live interviews feature. We needed those as a part of our research and ended up conducting them via Zoom. Really wish they could be added.",Feature Requests
"My best choice for card sorting.",Positive Feedback
"Their card sorting feature. It's a great tool that offers an insane amount of analytics and features for such a price.",Feature Requests
"The UI of the study setup could use a face lift, it's quite outdated.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Good value, love the audience sourcing function.",Positive Feedback
"Audience sourcing is great; we pay a nominal fee to target study respondents in our audience, and it's all integrated within the app. No need to use a different tool for audience sourcing. The respondents replied very quickly too, within days.",Usability & Workflow
"Oddly, the UX for UXtweak feels unintuitive (the left menu is a bit odd, and there are weird nuances that I can't quite put my finger on). However, the tool itself gets the job done, is cheaper than the competitor, and those are what matter!",Usability & Workflow
"Easy tool for tree testing with good exports for management.",Usability & Workflow
"I was doing tree-testing on our site because we have a lot of products, and our clients got lost on our web. My friend suggests my UXtweak. We made a study and sent it to our customers. We have quite quick answers, and what I liked the most is that UXtweak provides nice exports, so I can convince my web development team that we need to make changes in our website structure.",Usability & Workflow
"Setting up the study is a bit complicated, as many options exist. It's because you can use it in various ways, but it can be confusing if you want a simple study.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Great testing platform for a good price.",Positive Feedback
"Website and mobile app usability testing tools. I like that with this tool you actually get quality testing for an affordable price, we've tried other testing platforms before and UXtweak is by far the best.",Positive Feedback
"Nothing specific comes to mind, it's an overall good tool.",Positive Feedback
"Best UX research experience ever.",Positive Feedback
"UXTweak has an excellent user interface. It provided a smooth user experience to the participants in the focus group I organised-- many of them particularly mentioned that they liked using the platform and asked me about details.",Usability & Workflow
"Further, their customer support team is made up of experts who are quick at getting back to you and great at solving problems.",Positive Feedback
"It took a bit of time to get used to the dashboard layout, but everything became super efficient once I learned my way around the information structure, and I recommend it to anyone.",Positive Feedback
"Comparative pre- and post-study with a Framer high-fidelity prototype (MSc project).",Positive Feedback
"The flexibility regarding the questionnaire design, the ability to define technical requirements for the participants and the use of a custom 'Framer build' website by including a code snippet, which didn't require the participants to install additional plug-ins.",Usability & Workflow
"An additional highlight was the very responsive and helpful customer support and the available 'inline' participant recruiting!",Positive Feedback
"The UX of the UXtweak could be improved by some UX tweaks since some of the setup and analytics processes seemed counterintuitive and irritating. I found myself several times in a situation where I was not sure if I might not have accidentally deleted a test setup and was, therefore, continuously cloning setups.",Negative Feedback or Complaints

"Figma low fidelity prototype testing.",Positive Feedback
"We used UXtweak for Figma prototype testing. We are a local IT company and for our client, we needed to do quick testing of our prototypes. We know UXtweak as it is a well-known Slovak company. So we tried their prototype testing. It was very easy to use, we liked it imports Figma directly to UXtweak and we have our testing done in a few clicks. We also bought their testers and we were satisfied with the quality of respondents. Also, we had some issues with our Figma and their support solved it within 1 hour.",Usability & Workflow
"Sometimes it takes time to import Figma prototypes. I guess because of API. Also, the interface of UXtweak should be a little bit more designed. Their site is very modern, but the application can also be redesigned. But it is functional and easy to use.",Feature Requests
"Tree testing for my university project.",Positive Feedback
"The analysis included in the results. I needed to only glance at the Paths tab in results where we saw all the confusion our users suffered from when they tried to find what we thought was obvious.",Performance & Accuracy
"For my taste, it was a bit cumbersome to use from time to time. From what I've gathered it is aimed at more complex research than we actually needed. But that's not really a detriment to be honest.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Uxtweak was suggested to us by our marketing agency. We have a lot of products on our site, and the menu structure is confusing for our customers. So we decided to do Tree testing with our marketing agency with UXtweak. We liked that it is a simple tool, that you can research your own customers. Also perfect as we can make prescreening as we wanted only B2B customers, which are most important for us.",Positive Feedback
"Nothing particularly. Maybe pricing, but as I checked the competition, they are cheaper than other tools.",Positive Feedback
"We were looking for a tool for mobile usability testing of our beta version of the IOS app with a panellist, and sincerely UXtweak is the only solution we could find. So we were happy that someone was able to find the tool for our testing.",Versioning & Updates
"What we dislike is that setting up a panel needs to be done manually by the support of UXtweak, but we were informed that by the end of the year, we would be able to set up a panel by ourselves.",Feature Requests
"Great tools and customer service but UI could be improved.",Feature Requests
