The only suggestion I got was having an option for dev to check off the edits they've made on the page already in addition to the person who commented. Such a great idea and extension.

"Another one of those extensions that COULD have been perfect but it forces you to make an account. This could have worked without the need of an account, really dont see the reason why I need to make some account for this. I just used a disposable 10 minute mail account, dumb extension....",Feature Requests

However, would it be possible that you add a comment feature (like, your fellow project owner could reply back to the comment you made)? Thank you so much!",Feature Requests
"Great for UX research collaboration. Really clear and simple tool to use. I recommend it.",Positive Feedback
"I really like using this tool. I don't have to take notes or screenshots if I want to explain something to another member of the team. Heur.io simply puts a new layer on the web page and it's like taking notes on a transparent layer. The rest of the team, the designer, the marketer sees everything in one place and solves it instantly. It has saved us a lot of time and its structure is becoming more and more transparent and logical."

No need for complicated tickets or documents. Each comment is neatly organized and presented from most to least important making it easy for the devs to tackle.
