"Could it be that the lighthouse score is based on network latency and that you're experiencing some type of cold start on your http service?"
"I had a client complain once because their pagespeed score was in the low 40's. I ignored the email since this was an old site (built before pagespeed existed) and a client I fired for multiple reasons a few years back. Anyhow, they emailed to thank me the next day because the score was in the 90's. I didn't change a thing, nor did anyone else.

"Maybe your servers are inconsistent? check the details to see which resources are taking the longest."
"If you cannot consistently get 90+ scores, you need to optimize something. Might be server side, might be client side."
"I have done this many times and can get to 100 points with a bit of effort."
"Also i.e. IIS (Windows webserver) does not gzip compress static files unless they are accessed often - and other stuff like that. So everytime you need to run a Lighthouse test, press F5 a couple of times on the page before running the tool."
"Lighthouse measures real performance - so if you check an online website, and it sometimes has load from other visitors, your score will be affected because of lacking performance. If you cannot consistently get 90+ scores, you need to optimize something. Might be server side, might be client side. I have done this many times and can get to 100 points with a bit of effort.

You're just fooling yourself with that, if the cold load for a given page is slow, this is what your visitors will experience. Test under the worst possible conditions (empty server & client cache), then use the results to inform your optimization strategy. If the server doesn't gzip content where appropriate, go fix the server. "

"If you want to check for actual page speed then use https://pagespeed.web.dev/."
"That will grade your page speed as a Google Bot would, which is far more useful to know if you'll be indexed properly or not."
"Don't use the debug tools lighthouse scores, those are mainly for checking if you have bad imports or any accessibility issues. If you want to check for actual page speed then use https://pagespeed.web.dev/. That will grade your page speed as a Google Bot would, which is far more useful to know if you'll be indexed properly or not. 10 more replies 10 more replies More replies"

"You have to combine different versions of lighthouse. Some are synthetic some are real. I usually run bunch on web.dev, then some on my machine, mixed with gtmetrix and page speed insight."
"I did a video about Lighthouse earlier this year. I think it's great. It definitely found problems with my website and I fixed them."
"The numbers might fluctuate on a bunch of things. One... are you using http or https when you enter the URL? If your site redirects to https, you could lose points because of the redirection. If you're not using https, then you're going to lose points."
"It's hard to know if it's a problem with lighthouse without seeing the report. I've seen fluctuation of a few percentage points. But that big of a range is probably something else."
"I don't know what's wrong, but I suspect there might be something wrong with the site."

"I've also seen Lighthouse scores fluctuate pretty wildly - exact same page, run seconds apart. I started to asking averages, which gets pretty time-consuming, but hopefully a bit more reliable."
"Make sure to cross reference with lighthouse-metrics and gtmetrics because I have found sometimes mine and others sites will score very high on the later and poorly on the former which is curious"
"To get more consistent results you can try to use synthetic web performance monitoring using tools like SpeedCurve."
"Yep, Lighthouse behave strange last year, sometimes you change something in caching an it decreases Cumulative Layout Shift etc... I just working with main issues, and Lighthouse recommendations is just a hints, no more. I hope you know, the most important part is to render the first screen (above the fold) as fast as possible. Postpone loading of content below. Preloading images for first screen. Preferably no JS in header etc. It always go good, but CLS really hurts, and last time I don't understand why it can be fixed with caching reconfigured etc."
"By the way, real data from visitors for CLS is ok."
