"My mistake for not looking for reviews. This site can only give you a very simple error filled product of video generation for 4 to 5 seconds. That's with a $101.76 subscription for a year. Do not waste a penny. It is a scam and worthless. You can't trust anything anymore. I gave them a chance for 5 days, it's truly worthless. I am an idiot for not researching more. Avoid.Avoid.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"This company is a complete scam. Their ai program does work, but they'll attempt to scam you out of more money if you attempt to upgrade anything. The customer service is utterly deplorable, incompetent, and literally makes no attempt to fix any issues. Avoid this platform, so many better options.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"It is not accurate and it is not free. I asked three questions. The first was wrong, the answer should have been 6 instances, but indicated only 4. When challenged, the AI apologized. The second question, it did not answer. The third question it asked that I sign up for $10 a month.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"They cancelled my annual subscription after 1 month of course they charged me for the whole year and are ghosting me in support. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",Negative Feedback or Complaints
"Eespecially in excel it gives errors or I can get meaningless errors when I send a photo. However, when I write to support, they get back to me and try to solve the problem. Considering the price, it is very good.",Negative Feedback or Complaints

"Got to Yeschat whilst sourcing online sewing patterns. All it could produce was useless rectangles though it seemed to understand what I was after. So a waste of time, I have deleted all. I did try to e mail the company but nothing came back. If you have a tenner to waste then give it a go but don't hope for much.",Negative Feedback or Complaints

"Its a Scam. Initially the AI will come out with all the Bells and Whistles but after one or two days of reset of the no. of chats, the AI will come out with Bullshit results every Tom, D*** and Harry can understand OR the Admin will downgrade the AI at the background. Total Scam. PLEASE DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY, what ever the subscription level is.",Negative Feedback or Complaints

"I have the Pro plan which is the most basic paid subscription. And honestly, it's good. Sometimes the GPT's can respond a bit slow. I mainly only use it for one GPT there but it does what I need and the customer service has also been good whenever I've emailed them about something.",Positive Feedback
