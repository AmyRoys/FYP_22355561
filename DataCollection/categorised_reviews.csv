"I had a client complain once because their pagespeed score was in the low 40's. I ignored the email since this was an old site (built before pagespeed existed) and a client I fired for multiple reasons a few years back. Anyhow, they emailed to thank me the next day because the score was in the 90's. I didn't change a thing, nor did anyone else.

"In terms of accessibility you'd be better off using aXe dev tools or running aXe against your pages via automated tests. Lighthouse uses a subset of aXe tests for accessibility, aXe itself only covers about 50%, iirc, of WCAG standards. Essentially Lighthouse is a good indicator of accessibility but it isn't that comprehensive and ultimately if you think ""wow we got 100 for a11y on Lighthouse"" and never bother to test accessibility any further you've probably got a bunch of a11y issues.", "Feature Requests, Negative Feedback or Complaints"

"You're right. I've been doing SEO for years now for clients and on my own site. I rank #2 for a few local keywords, and I'll never rank #1. Wanna know why? The #1 spot has a PBN. My site is objectively better in terms of on page SEO, UX, lighthouse / page speed scores, and I have a blog that pumps out fresh content (he doesn't have one). But Google doesn't care. It's because he has a PBN setup with thousands of backlinks, is why he holds that spot. No matter what Google says, ranking well has always been about and will always be about backlinks.",Versioning & Updates
"Ultimately, Google and any other search engine is interested in showing the best results for a given query to users. How often a user clicks on a result and whether or not the user returns to search and ends up clicking a different result are basically the most important thing for ranking. But they also know that things like performance and responsiveness and accessibility are, in addition to content, important factors in predicting whether a user will remain on a site or leave (if the page is really slow, you're gonna have a bad experience, and possibly go elsewhere). So performance is just one of many factors. Relevance to the query and how many users made a similar query for which that result was what they were looking for are and should be the most important factors. That basically means the popularity of a site is one of the key factors in ranking.","Performance & Accuracy, Negative Feedback or Complaints"
"To be clear, lighthouse scores is a TIE BREAKER. The search term matching is absolutely more important and it's honestly going to be rare where you have the same score as another website and lighthouse scoring tiebreaker will come into play. Get high LH scores to make your site more pleasant to use, not to get a higher ranking on SERP.",
"Page speed is massively overstated for SEO. It's a very small factor. Of course it's good to have a fast site anyway, for your users, but most people wouldn't notice a difference between 80-100 lighthouse score. Plus lighthouse massively undervalues TTFB (time to first byte).", Feature Requests
"It's just a tie breaker. That's it, you honestly shouldn't expect it to place you more than a single ranking higher. I've never seen it have an effect tbh. That said, absolutely try to get a good ranking (doesn't need to be 100/100) because it makes your site more pleasant to use.", Performance & Accuracy
"It depends on what your site is for. I basically think of the following dichotomy: sites people have to use vs sites people don't have to use. An example of a site people don't have to use is an online retailer. Since people could go elsewhere, performance really matters. It's showing how a minor bit of extra time to load can affect conversion numbers. Here you should be aiming to get that lighthouse score perfect. An example of a site people have to use is a B2B sass app that does some business function like product management software, intranets, etc. Its users HAVE to use it because their company paid for them to use it. While we should strive to build performant sites every time blah blah blah, the truth is it becomes much less important in these kind of sites as you essentially have a captive audience.","Usability & Workflow, Performance & Accuracy, Versioning & Updates"
"Well that to Amazon, last time I checked their lighthouse site performance was 30 something.",Performance & Accuracy
"In my opinion, having a decent Lighthouse/page speed/etc. score should be the bare minimum. There are a lot of other factors to consider when thinking of quality and speed (which are not mutually exclusive): perceived speed and providing feedback in the UI when things are happening, length of flows (especially with checkouts), amount of info collected on forms, partial updates vs full page loads (non-SPA), ensuring minimal re-renders (SPA), pagination vs infinite scroll and when to use them. There are no scoring tools for a 'good' website. But using things like Lighthouse and page speed are a good indicator it isn't your code causing the problems.","Usability & Workflow, Versioning & Updates"
"I'm not really concerned with SEO. I try to make websites that are fast, nice to use, accessible, and have a low web carbon. Lighthouse is a useful metric for this.",
"Google wants that the stuff you find on google works. If you used google and only found crappy pages that took seconds to load, you'd think google was crap.",
"Does it matter? Depends. looks like you're thinking about in SERPs. IMHO in 20 years of SEO, the same ideas still hold true. Have backlinks, Create good content , (Use words your customers are searching for in your headings and other content areas), and make the site easy to use where they don't bounce. That's it. The pagespeed score factors in there somewhere, but all those technical metrics only matter when everything else is about equal. It's why older or slow sites still rank well. People keep going there and people keep linking to it, and they keep linking to it because people go there..... and so on. I've had customers obsess of synthetic metrics, meanwhile they want to rank for terms they don't even have service pages for, or are thin on content. SMH.","Usability & Workflow, Versioning & Updates"
"It is a relatively small factor. It does play a role in ranking, however most other factors have to be very similar between sites for it to come into effect.",
"Good question. It should matter but if they don't then perhaps it's another sign that search engines have lost the SEO war. The systems they introduced to return the best results from the internet were quickly overwhelmed by people learning to game the algorithm for profit. Once Google achieved its near total search monopoly, they shifted to serving adverts over good quality results so things like Lighthouse scores don't get a chance to make the difference. That said, I still think the audits are valuable. The metrics are measuring tangible, real-world things and it's the most universal front end analysis tool to you can see how site A compares with site B. I do think a site with a good Lighthouse score (achieved genuinely) usually feels better to use, and while that may not matter as much to search engines, it still matters to users. Also, because they're presented in a style that's digestible by anyone, you can use the results in presentations too.","Usability & Workflow, Performance & Accuracy"

I work at a relatively larger tech company and we've had multiple drop-everything perf issues because Google notified us that we'd start getting down ranked if we didn't fix perf on specific pages. That said, some sites are so relevant that having bad performance doesn't really impact their ratings. If you search for short term rentals somewhere, Airbnb is getting clicks and converts so often that they're going to stay at the top essentially no matter what. Site performance is a very important metric, but it's not the only metric, so things balance out.","Performance & Accuracy, Negative Feedback or Complaints"
"I'm of the mindset that building performant web apps is so easy that you'd be stupid not too. Honestly I find it harder to get bad scores and the code becomes a pain to read. Just follow best practices for HTML, CSS & JavaScript and then even when building something in React or another framework it'll usually end up good enough. I usually end up with things being built with at least 85 performance, easily tweaked to 100. I've heard some people have issues with analytics trackers etc.","Usability & Workflow, Performance & Accuracy, Negative Feedback or Complaints"
"Not much, until someone ignorant enough makes it your quarterly KPI.", Negative Feedback or Complaints
"It's a very impactful metric. Especially for small business sites in local markets. The reason the bigger sites can get away with low scores is because their domain authority makes up for it. They have tens of thousands of backlinks and social media engagement and reach online that their page speed score doesn't really matter. When you have a high authority site with 20k backlinks and lots of social engagement versus a new site with no backlinks and no social profiles but 100 page speed scores guess who's gonna win? Thats how it works. Small business sites don't have the Authority those big sites have. So they need to play the game a lot differently and that's where page speed matters the most. They don't have domain authority. So they need to make up for it on content quality and page speed scores to gain an edge over their local competition.", Performance & Accuracy
