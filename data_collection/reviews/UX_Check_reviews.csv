"Nothing happens when clicking on the icon. ***UPDATE***: I quit Chrome and reopened and now it appears to be working. There's a lot a like about it, but unfortunately its missing a few UX points that overshadow what's helpful about it. 1. Can't edit custom list items once they've been saved. 2. Can't rearrange the order of the items in a custom list 3. Can't add custom items to the pre-existing template or easily copy them into a new project.",Feature Requests

"It's super practical, thanks for this tool! :) Some ideas for improvement: - It would be necessary to be able to take several screenshots of the same problem. - To be able to visually annotate the screenshots - To be able to save an analysis to come back to it later - To be able to choose the language",Feature Requests

"I like the concept and overall is a pretty nice tool. It will definitely quicken the documentation process. However, my only concern is that it is a buggy and does not work 5 out of ten times. I keep clicking the icon and nothing really happens. I would give it a 5 star if this was not an issue.",Negative Feedback or Complaints
